                    Most of the universe is empty space, called a vacuum, 
                    but it is an imperfect vacuum. There are clouds of interstellar 
                    dust and the tiny particles that make up the solar wind. .

                There are many isolated particles and hydrogen atoms, which sometimes
                form clouds over a billion kilometers wide called "nebulae

                    " Besides nebulae and interstellar dust, there are also bits of
                    rubble as big as small moons to as small as grains of sand. These
                    bits of rubble are called planetoids and asteroids. Radio, heat,
                    and x-rays all echo through space, as do beams of light. There is
                    radiation bursting forth in solar flares.
